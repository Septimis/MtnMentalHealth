            <p class="infoParagraph">What about our mental health? Nearly 44 million Americans, nearly 1 in 5 adults, struggle with a mental health issue in a given year. For too long individuals who suffer from a mental health disorder have chosen to ignore their symptoms in fear of the social stigma that has persistently clung to mental illness. That has to stop.</p>
            <p class=infoParagraph>There is increasing awareness in the scientific community of the link between our physical health and our psychological health. Untreated mental illness has profound consequences to our health and wellbeing, including increased risk of heart disease, a weakened immune system, reduced lifespan, financial instability, interpersonal problems, career fallout, and legal issues.</p>
            <p class=infoParagraph>The mind-body connection is real. To maximize overall health and well-being it is critical that mental health disorders be addressed and treated. Treatment of mental health conditions provides the needed support to both manage symptoms and process unresolved traumas or painful emotional events that may be contributing to the disorder.
