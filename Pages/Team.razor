My journey in mental health is informed not only by my clinical expertise but also by a passion for holistic care that integrates nature and outdoor activities. Having taught at the college level, I value education and strive to empower my clients with knowledge and tools for their mental wellness. My experience as a wilderness guide has taught me the profound healing power of the outdoors, and I incorporate these elements into my therapeutic approach. Whether through hikes, mindfulness practices in nature, or simply encouraging outdoor activities, I believe that connecting with the natural world can enhance mental health and resilience.  I work with individuals of all ages facing a variety of mental health challenges, including anxiety, depression, trauma, and stress-related issues. My goal is to create a safe, supportive environment where clients can explore their thoughts and feelings, develop coping strategies, and find their path to healing."/>
